Background of the problem statement:

 The flow of the program:

Displayed welcome screen and main menu options.
User selects an option from the main menu.
Depending on the option selected, perform the following operations:

a. Option 1: Display all files in the directory.
b. Option 2: Add a file to the directory.
c. Option 3: Search for a file in the directory.
d. Option 4: Exit the program.

If the user enters an invalid input, display an error message and prompt the user again.
