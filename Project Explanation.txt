To start, let's break down the requirements and tasks into manageable pieces.

Sprint Planning:

The first step is to break down the project into sprints. Here is one possible breakdown:

Sprint 1 (1 week):

Develop the welcome screen
Retrieve the file names in ascending order
Add a file to the existing directory list
Delete a user-specified file from the existing directory list
Sprint 2 (1 week):

Search a user-specified file from the main directory
Navigation option to close the current execution context and return to the main context
Option to close the application
Sprint 3 (1 week):

Test the application

Optimize the source code by implementing appropriate concepts such as exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques
Prepare documentation and submit the final specification document
Git and GitHub Setup:
Before starting the development, you need to set up Git and GitHub account to store and track your enhancements of the prototype. Here are the steps:


 Java concepts:

File I/O operations: To read, write, and delete files
Exception handling: To handle errors and prevent the application from crashing
Collections: To store and manipulate data efficiently
Sorting techniques: To sort the file names in ascending order
For the search and delete operations, you can use binary search algorithm since the file names will be in ascending order.

Application Flow and Features:

Here is the flow and features of the LockedMe.com application:

Display the welcome screen with the application name and developer details
Display the options for user interaction
Option 1: Retrieve the file names in ascending order
Option 2: Add, delete, or search a user-specified file
Option 3: Close the application
For option 2, display the appropriate user interface and accept user input
Return a message if the operation is unsuccessful
Provide navigation option to return to the main context
Specification Document:
The specification document should include the following:

Project and developer details

Sprints planned and the tasks achieved in them
Algorithms and flowcharts of the application
Core concepts used in the project
Links to the GitHub repository to verify the project completion
Conclusion on enhancing the application and defining the USPs (Unique Selling Points)

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the LockedMe.com project can be completed in three sprints by planning the development in terms of sprints and implementing the appropriate Java concepts and 
data structures. Git and GitHub can be used to store and track the enhancements of the prototype. The specification document should include the details of the project, 
sprints, algorithms, and flowcharts, and the GitHub repository link. By implementing the optimized source code and delivering the product incrementally, the application 
can be enhanced and its USPs defined.
